**Final Project Revised Proposal**

**Project idea**
An interactive art piece made with processing and arduino. The art piece would be a flowing river with fish swimming through it. Users would be able to control the speed of river flow/fish by using the potentiometer. According to how bright the room is, the brightness of the scene will also change(simulate day/night). By clicking on a button, the user can create bubbles on the river. If there is any loud noise in the room, the bubbles will burst and change into an image of flower. 

**Materials**
I will create this by using the ultrasonic sensor, the photoresistor, potentiometer and the buttons to control some aspects of the art.

**Chanllenges I might face**
I think the most chanllenging part of this would be to inroporate the ultrasoinic sensor since I haven't used it in my previous projects and have never used it before. Ideally, I would like to have background music for this piece. However, I am not sure how that would intervene with the bursting-bubble-on-noise part. I am also slightly nervous about the coding part because it looks like a lot to me. Since I plan to make this piece pretty big relative to our other projects on processing(hopefully fullscreen), I am also worried about it being too intense and won't run properly on my laptop.
