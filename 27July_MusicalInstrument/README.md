**Assignment 5 - Musical Instrument **

For this assignment, I try to make a muscial instrument that also lights up. The circuit consists of 3 LED bulbs and 4 switches. 3 of the switches corresponds to 3 different notes and each of them will light up a different bulb. For the fourth switch, it lights up all 3 bulbs ramdomly and plays a random note each time a different light bulb is on. The motor is connected to a metal bar that repeatedly hit on a glass bottle to create notes. 

**Set up of the circuit**
