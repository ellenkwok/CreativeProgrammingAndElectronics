**Midterm Project**

**documentation in progress** **check back later I will get these up soon**

**My improvements to the project**

In order to improve my paint program project, I made the following addtion/modification to my program:

* A home page that consists of the game name and two menu options: "Instructions" and "Start"

* An Instruction page that contains the instructions and game tips, and also a button to start the game immediately

* Background music

* New sound effects: when you touch the character's face or go too far away from her head, a child crying sound wll play; When you finish the game, there will be a cheering sound effect

* When you finish the game, a Thank You message from the girl will pop up along with sound effect

* You can now also restart the game immediately after playing by clicking the restart button

* Modifciation to the brush shape - It was changed from a square shape to a circle as I find that to be a better shape to draw with
