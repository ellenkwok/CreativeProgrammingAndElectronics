**Final Project Proposal** 

For my final project, I would like to make an interactive art piece with processing and arduino. My vision of this is that it will be an drawing of a river made with processing. I will use processing to animate some fish in the water and the movement of the water. According to how bright the room is, the brightness of the image will also change(simulate day/night). By clicking on a button, the user can create bubbles on the river. If there is any loud noise in the room, the bubbles will burst and change into an image of flower. 

I will create this by using the ultrasonic sensor, the photoresistor, and the buttons to control some aspects of the art.
