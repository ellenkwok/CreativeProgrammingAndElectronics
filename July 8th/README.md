This is my self-portrait made with processing. I major in Cognitive Science and I really like learning about the brain. 
Therefore, I decided to make myself but with the brain visible and rainbow coming out of my brain. This is supposed to convey my feelings
of being fascinated by the brain with my own brain. 

The processing of making this was both 
more difficult and easier than I thought at the same time. I originally wanted to attempt making something a little less cartoon-ish, but I quickly
realized that it will be very difficult to get right. I sketched up a draft on paper and things became a lot easier from there. An interesting thing about
doing this is that this forces me to pay attention to where things lie in a space, which helps with composition a lot.
